/** Question 40
 * Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
 * The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing 
 * these two pieces of information. 
 * Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
 * Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
 * Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
 * If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
 * Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
